**Here is a simple, clear explanation of an image encryption tool using pixel manipulation**

🔐 SIMPLE IMAGE ENCRYPTION USING PIXEL MANIPULATION

This kind of encryption works by changing the pixels of an image so the picture becomes unreadable, but in a reversible way so it can be decrypted later.
There are two common simple methods:

✅ 1. Pixel Swapping (Scrambling)

⭐ What it is:

This method rearranges pixels in the image.
Instead of changing pixel colors, it changes their positions.

⭐ How it works:

The tool takes two neighboring pixels.

It swaps their places in the image.

It repeats this across the whole picture.

⭐ Why it works for encryption:

The image becomes distorted and unreadable.

To decrypt, you simply perform the same swaps again, which returns everything to its original place.

✅ 2. Mathematical Pixel Manipulation

⭐ What it is:

This method changes the color values (numbers) of each pixel.

⭐ How it works:

Each color (red, green, blue) is stored as a number from 0 to 255.

The tool adds or subtracts a key number (like 50) to these values.

⭐ Why it works

These changes make the image look tinted, distorted, or completely unrecognizable.
To decrypt, you subtract the same number you added.

🎨 Why These Methods Are Simple:

They do not require advanced math or cryptography.

They work directly on pixel values.

They can be easily reversed to restore the original image.
